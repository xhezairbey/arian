    I am a technology evangelist with a bunch of CISCO certificates, and more than 7 years doing this web thing. A trainer who spoke in couple of local mini-cons, appeared in national public TVs and can stand in front of an audience like a fearless fictional superhero. My family name is pronounced <strong>d íezai:ri</strong>, I am Albanian and worked for Ogilvy Interactive.

    I am fluent in several languages, including HTML5, CSS3, PHP5, SQL, and Ruby. JavaScript is not my favorite language, but I know enough of jQuery to tackle every aspect of front-end development, from DOM manipulation to the cool mind-blowing effects.<br /> Oh, and AJAX too.
  %p I hold a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering, majoring in Relational Database Management Systems.
